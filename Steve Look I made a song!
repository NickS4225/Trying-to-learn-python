#function 1 takes X & Y. Y is set to 10 as a default
#repeat_stuff running returns Row * 3, so Row Row Row.
#lyrics outputs row *3 and "your boat" to the end of function 1
#song runs function 1 on row*3 and your boat. 
#does it output 10 times because the default is 10?
#yes.
# question is - why?


#outputs - Row Row Row Your Boat. (10 times)
